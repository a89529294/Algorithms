// A hash function is a function that takes in a string and returns a number
// There are two requirements:
// 1. It needs to be consistent, for the same string the function should return the same number.
// 2. Every string should map to an unique number.

// You can make a hash table by combining a hash function with an array.
// Hash tables have really fast search, insert, and delete. O(1) time
