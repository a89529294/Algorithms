// The algorithm to solve a shortest-path problem is called breadth-first search.

// 1. Model the problem as a graph.
// 2. Solve the problem using breadth-first search.

// Graph:
// 1. Made up of nodes & edges.
// 2. A node can be directly connected to many other nodes by edges. Those nodes are called its neighbors.

// BFS answers two types of questions:
// 1. Is there a path from node A to node B?
// 2. What is the shortest path from node A to node B?

// Queue: FIFO
// STACK: LIFO

// Directed v.s. Undirected Graphs
// A -> B, i.e. B is A's neighbor but not the other way around. (Directed)
// A - B, i.e. B and A are each others' neighbors. (Undirected)
